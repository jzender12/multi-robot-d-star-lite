# Multi-Robot D* Lite Path Planning System

This is a complete multi-agent path planning system using D* Lite for a 10x10 grid with two robots. The implementation focuses on correctness and clarity. The system demonstrates D* Lite's incremental replanning capabilities with collision detection that pauses simulation when robots would collide.

**Important**: In this implementation, robots do NOT act as obstacles during path planning. This allows paths to potentially overlap, with collision detection catching conflicts at runtime and pausing the simulation for user intervention.

## Understanding D* Lite

D* Lite maintains two distance values for each cell: the g-value (current best distance) and the rhs-value (one-step lookahead distance). When these values disagree, the cell is inconsistent and needs processing. The algorithm searches backward from goal to start, enabling efficient replanning as the robot moves.

## Key Design Decisions

### 4-Connected Grid with Manhattan Distance
- **Movement**: Robots can only move to cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) - no diagonal movement
- **Heuristic**: Manhattan distance (`|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|`)
- **Cost**: All moves have cost 1.0

### Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy
1. **Independent Planning**: Robots plan paths without considering other robots as obstacles
2. **Comprehensive Collision Detection**: System detects three collision types and pauses simulation:
   - **Same-Cell**: Both robots trying to enter the same cell
   - **Swap**: Robots exchanging positions
   - **Shear**: Robot entering cell that another is leaving perpendicularly
3. **Stuck Robot Handling**: Robots unable to reach goals are visually indicated and logged
   - Simulation continues without pausing
   - Red border indicates stuck robots
   - Game log shows warning messages
4. **Dynamic Replanning**: When obstacles are added/removed, all robots replan using D* Lite's incremental updates
5. **Clean Slate Resizing**: Arena resize clears everything and places robot1 at start
6. **Duplicate Prevention**: Robots cannot share starting positions

## Core Implementation Details

### GridWorld (world.py)
- Manages grid with static obstacles and robot positions
- `is_free()` checks if a cell is traversable (only checks static obstacles, NOT robots)
- `get_neighbors()` returns only 4 cardinal neighbors with cost 1.0
- Robots stored in `robot_positions` but don't block paths during planning
- **NEW**: `resize(width, height)` - Dynamically resize grid (3x3 to 30x30)
  - Preserves obstacles within new bounds
  - Removes out-of-bounds content
  - Enforces min/max size limits

### D* Lite Algorithm (dstar_lite.py)
- **Critical**: `km` parameter accumulates with each robot move for correctness
- Uses Manhattan heuristic: `abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])`
- Lexicographic priority queue ordering via tuple comparison
- `update_edge_costs()` enables incremental replanning when obstacles change

### Multi-Agent Coordinator (coordinator.py)
Key methods:
- `recompute_paths()`: Computes paths for all robots after changes
- `detect_collision_at_next_step()`: Comprehensive collision detection that checks for:
  1. **Same-cell collisions**: Both robots entering same position
  2. **Swap collisions**: Robots exchanging positions
  3. **Shear collisions**: Perpendicular crossing (one enters as another exits)
  - Note: Robots moving in the same direction (series/convoy) are correctly allowed
- `step_simulation()`: Moves robots, detects collisions, and identifies stuck robots
  - Returns tuple: (should_continue, collision_info, stuck_robots)
  - Stuck robots continue simulation without pausing
- `set_new_goal()`: Sets new goal with validation:
  - Returns `True` if successful, `False` if invalid
  - Prevents goals on obstacles
  - Prevents multiple robots having same goal
- **NEW**: `remove_robot(robot_id)` - Remove a robot from the system
- **NEW**: `get_next_robot_id()` - Generate next sequential robot ID
- **NEW**: `clear_all_robots()` - Remove all robots
- **NEW**: `resize_world(width, height)` - Resize to clean slate with robot1
- **NEW**: `reset_to_default()` - Reset to 10x10 clean slate
- **NEW**: `add_robot()` returns bool - False if position occupied

### Visualization (visualizer.py & __main__.py)
Interactive features:
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Game log (left, 200px), Grid (center), Control panel (right, 200px)
- **Start paused**: Shows initial setup for easier scenario building
- **Dynamic goal setting**: While paused, click robot then click to set new goal
- **Obstacle manipulation**: Click to add/remove obstacles with validation
  - **Place Mode**: Click individual cells to toggle obstacles (default)
  - **Draw Mode**: Click and drag to continuously place obstacles
  - Toggle modes with 'O' key or control panel button
- **Placement validation**: Prevents invalid placements:
  - Cannot place obstacles on robots or goals
  - Cannot place goals on obstacles or other robot goals
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Selected robots highlighted with yellow border
  - Stuck robots indicated with red border
  - Paths shown in robot-specific colors
- **Coordinate transformation**: Mouse clicks adjusted for log panel offset (200px)

### Game Log (game_log.py)
- **Scrollable log panel**: Displays simulation events with timestamps
- **Message types**: info, warning, error, success, collision (each with unique colors)
- **Auto-scrolling**: Automatically scrolls to latest messages
- **Manual scrolling**: Mouse wheel support with auto-scroll disable
- **Message limit**: Maintains last 100 messages for performance
- **Word wrapping**: Long messages wrapped to fit panel width

### UI Components (ui_components.py)
- **Button class**: Interactive buttons with hover/click states
- **ControlPanel class**: Comprehensive control panel with:
  - Add/Remove robot buttons
  - Arena size presets (5x5, 10x10, 15x15, 20x20)
  - Speed control
  - Obstacle mode toggle (Place/Draw modes)
  - Clear All / Reset buttons
  - Robot count display
- **ButtonGroup**: Manages exclusive button selection

### Color Generation (utils/colors.py)
- **Dynamic color generation**: Unique colors for unlimited robots
- **HSV color space**: Even distribution around color wheel
- **Predefined colors**: Robot1 (blue) and Robot2 (red) fixed
- **Color sets**: Matching colors for robot/goal/path
- **Color caching**: Consistent colors across sessions

**Note**: `main.py` now simply imports from `__main__.py` to avoid code duplication

## Recent Features (Added via TDD)

- Runs your command
- Cleans up on exit (even on errors)

## Visual Test Format

Test cases are defined in `test_cases.txt` using an intuitive visual format:

```
TEST_NAME
5x5
1 . . . A   # 1=robot1 start, A=robot1 goal
. X X X .   # X=obstacle, .=empty
. . . . .
. X X X .
B . . . 2   # 2=robot2 start, B=robot2 goal
```

### Tools for Test Cases

- **multi_robot_d_star_lite/utils/parse_test_grid.py**: Parses visual format into GridWorld setup
- **multi_robot_d_star_lite/utils/export_grid.py**: Exports current grid state to visual format
- **tests/test_collision.py**: Unified test runner that loads all tests from test_cases.txt

During simulation, press 'C' when paused to copy the current grid state to clipboard for creating new test cases.

## How It Works

1. **Initial State**: Clean 10x10 grid with robot1 at (0,0), goal at (9,9)
2. **Path Planning**: Each robot runs D* Lite independently WITHOUT considering other robots
3. **Collision Detection**: System checks for three types of collisions:
   - Same-cell: Both robots trying to enter same position
   - Swap: Robots exchanging positions
   - Shear: Perpendicular crossing where one robot enters a cell another is leaving
4. **Collision Response**: Simulation PAUSES when collision detected, displaying the specific collision type
5. **Placement Validation**: Prevents invalid configurations:
   - Goals cannot be placed on obstacles
   - Multiple robots cannot have the same goal or position
   - Obstacles cannot be placed on robots or goals
6. **Arena Resizing**: Creates clean slate with robot1 only
7. **Dynamic Updates**: When obstacles change, D* Lite efficiently replans using incremental updates

## Key Insights from Development

### Current Implementation Approach
- Robots plan independently without considering each other as obstacles
- This can lead to path overlaps, which are caught by collision detection
- Simulation pauses on collision, displaying the collision type (same-cell, swap, or shear)
- Series movement (convoy) and parallel movement are correctly allowed without triggering collisions
- This approach is simpler and makes robot behavior more predictable

### Why This Design
- Treating robots as obstacles can lead to no valid paths in tight spaces
- Independent planning ensures robots always find paths if one exists
- Collision detection provides safety without complex resolution logic

### Critical Implementation Details
1. **km accumulation**: Must update every robot move, not just during replanning
2. **Iteration limit**: Set to width * height * 100 to handle complex grids
3. **Manhattan heuristic**: Uses 4-connected grid, no diagonal movement
4. **Dynamic obstacles**: Modify world and call `update_edge_costs()` for efficient replanning

## Summary

This implementation demonstrates that multi-agent pathfinding doesn't require complex frameworks. By leveraging D* Lite's natural obstacle avoidance and adding simple temporal collision resolution, we achieve robust multi-robot coordination. The key is understanding that robots are just dynamic obstacles, and D* Lite already knows how to handle obstacles efficiently.
